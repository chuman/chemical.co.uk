      <h3>Missing money</h3>
      <h4>Updated 13th June 2015</h4>
In my original post, there was the mention of &pound;150,000 that was accumulated during the trading of the company in the administration period.<br>
When the creditor report was published, this money was nowhere to be seen. I emailed Baker Tilly to ask about the money three or four times over six months and never received a reply. It was only when I received a response to a complaint I had raised with ACCA over the conduct of Sandy Kinninmonth that an answer was received. They agreed that the money had been hidden but that as it didn't affect the creditors then there was no harm done (seriously?!). Unfortunately, I disagree with this under the <a href="http://www.jldllp.co.uk/prescribed.html">prescribed part law</a>. This states that 20% of secured funds must be made available to unsecured creditors.<br>
This is where it gets a little more interesting. The following is an email from Andrew Rumsey of Baker Tilly:<br><br>
<div class="boxed">
Dear Chris<br>
 <br>
I refer to your emails dated 5 and 9 June 2015.<br>
 <br>
The £150,000 you refer to was received by the bank, in the normal course of trading, in the period prior to the appointment of the Joint Administrators.<br>
 <br>
The prescribed part is a fund that is set aside when funds are distributed by office holders (Joint Administrators and/or Joint Liquidators) to secured creditors under their floating charge. This distribution is made from funds realised by the Joint Administrators during the period of their appointment and made after the costs of the insolvency procedure have been deducted. In our latest report (August 14) it refers to £9,958 having been set aside in accordance with the prescribed part. This is the calculated sum following the distribution of £19,515 to Barclays under their floating charge.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, as the Joint Administrators were never (and should never have been) in receipt of the £150,000 you refer to, those are not funds that should be taken into account by the Joint Administrators in calculating the prescribed part.<br>
 <br>
As requested, I attach a copy of my email to you dated 12 November 2014, together with your response of the same date.<br>
 <br>
As these matters are currently the subject of an investigation by the ACCA, I am copying this exchange of correspondence to Mr Slattery at the ACCA for his information.<br>
 <br>
Kind regards<br>
 <br>

Ok.... Now let's see what Barclays have to say about it:<br><br>

<div class="boxed">
Mr Ramsay,<br>
 <br>
In terms of the account, it was ran and is being run by the Administrators and not Barclays Bank. We have issued copy statements previously to you following the authority from the Administrators to provide you with them. We have not controlled any funds which have been sent to the account.<br>
 <br>
Kind regards,<br>
 <br>

It's worth noting that this is one of the few pieces of correspondence from Barclays on the matter. The denials of receipt of this cash have largely been over phone.<br>
<br>
So... it's nothing to do with Barclays and it's nothing to do with Baker Tilly? Well, I've offered to send them my bank details and they can send the money to me.<br><br>
More seriously, though, is why are they both lying? The simple answer (in my opinion and based on the facts I have) is that Barclays and Baker Tilly came to an agreement to drag out the administration period for as long as possible in order to obtain as many funds as possible. They then hid these funds from the creditors so that they could keep it all to themselves. The money was being held in Barclays Merchant Services - it was only when I complained profusely to Barclays and Baker Tilly, and raised complaints with their various bodies, that the money suddenly appeared (over a year after the company had been closed) in Barclays' account.<br><br>
20% (&pound;30,000) should have been made available to the unsecured creditors. If you were one of these creditors, I'd contact Baker Tilly and ask where the money is.<br><br>
There was a lot of interest from Barclays and Baker Tilly over my previous update, but they weren't prepared to issue any kinds of statements. Again, I will happily publish anything they wish to say on this matter.<br>
